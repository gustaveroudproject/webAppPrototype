Gulio Andreini, “How we designed Galassia Ariosto”, _UX Collective_, 9 Jan 2018, [https://uxdesign.cc/how-we-designed-galassia-ariosto-9434e2732714](https://uxdesign.cc/how-we-designed-galassia-ariosto-9434e2732714).

We also found a lot of information in [UX Booth](https://www.uxbooth.com/), Wikipedia, the [Web Style Guide](https://webstyleguide.com/) by Lynch and Horton, [NN/g](https://www.nngroup.com/), the [Collectif](https://archinfo.umontreal.ca) francophone sur l’architecture de l’information.
