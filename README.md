# About this report

This document recounts the process we followed to create a prototype for the web application of the project [Gustave Roud, _Œuvres complètes_](https://www.unil.ch/clsr/home/menuinst/projets-de-recherche/gustave-roud-oeuvres-completes.html), directed by Daniel Maggetti and Claire Jaquier. This was a joint effort of the researchers working on the project: \(in alphabetical order\) Alessio Christen, Bruno Pellegrino, Elena Spadini, Julien Burri and Raphaëlle Lacord. Disclaimer: we are not front-end developers.

The prototype was completed in 2018. We knew that, before the end of the project scheduled for 2021, there will be many unforeseen developments and that our prototype could not guide entirely the actual development of the web application. Nevertheless, it was a useful accomplishment, in order to clarify our ideas and to provide a foundation for the web development.

In this report the results are shown first and, afterwards, the entire process is presented. Some parts of the report are in English and some are in French.
